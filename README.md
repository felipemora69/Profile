#Interactive Web Features

This project showcases several interactive web functionalities such as displaying profile pictures with delayed name display, 
updating the current date and time in real-time, converting numerical grades to letter grades, sorting staff members in a table, 
and converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
These features are implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and jQuery for frontend interactivity.
