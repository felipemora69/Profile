        <p> Hi, I'm Felipe!<br>
            
            I'm currently finishing my Software Development diploma at Bow Valley College, and I hold a Bachelor of Business Administration. Over the last 6 years, I've had the opportunity to work in various roles that required me to manage responsibilities and lead teams. This experience has helped me gain a strong foundation in project management, data analysis, and web development.<br>
            
            This website features three main sections: Home, <b>Mark-to-Grade</b>, and Staff. In the Home section, the user's profile picture appears first, followed by their name after 10 seconds, while the current date and time are displayed and updated every second. The Mark-to-Grade section allows users to input a mark between 0-100 and receive a corresponding letter grade (A-F), with color-coded feedback for passing and failing grades. If the input is invalid, an error message is shown. <b>The Staff</b> section displays a list of employees with details such as name, position, and salary, which can be sorted by name or salary in ascending or descending order. Additionally, <b>the Weather</b> section provides temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit, updating the result dynamically based on user input. The website combines real-time updates, interactive grading, sorting, and conversions to create a functional and engaging user experience.
